In this module, we will take the problem of learning a boolean conjunction
of binary variables using examples (values of the variables and the evaluation
of the unknown conjunction on them). We will formulate the problem in the
"Probably Approximately Correct" (PAC) framework, and explore the formulation 
probabilisitically. This framework will also be a lesson on how most learning
guarantees work.
