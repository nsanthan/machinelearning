EE 445 is an undergraduate level introduction to Machine Learning for Electrical and Computer Engineering students. It uses your strengths in probability, linear algebra, and related engineering concepts in linear methods, signal processing, signals and systems to provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning fundamentals.

## Who should take this course

This course is intended for undergraduates in computer science or computer engineering who have a working knowledge of at least one programming language and who want to get a taste of important topics in the field.

## Pedagogy

ICS 199 is structured as a sequential series of [modules](/modules), each taking approximately a week to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Prerequisites](/prerequisites), describing skills you should have prior to starting the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/readings), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/experiences), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

## About the instructor

[Narayana Prasad Santhanam](https://ee.hawaii.edu/faculty/profile?usr=63) is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Hawaii. My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, information theory and statistics. A particular focus is on high dimensional and complex problems, that are not amenable to traditional statistical methods and guarantees.
