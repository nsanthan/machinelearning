# Theory

Show how a single neuron with an appropriate choice of activation, loss function and regularization can mimic (i) Ridge Regression, (ii) Lasso (iii) (linear) Support Vector Machines.

# Practice

Implement all the above. For OLS and linear Support vector machines, try to get the trained neuron weights as close to the optimal values calculated by vanilla OLS and linear SVM respectively.
