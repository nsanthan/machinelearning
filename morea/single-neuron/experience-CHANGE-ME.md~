# Build and train on keras

The following python
[notebook](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee445/morea/single-neuron/perceptron.ipynb)
walks you through building a perceptron and replicating the Perceptron Algorithm using
the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Along these lines, you are asked to replicate
the Linear Regression and the Support Vector Machine algorithms as well.
